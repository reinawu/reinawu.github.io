      <h1>Is it possible to pull 1.4 billion Chinese people into a WeChat group technically?</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        "Recently, there is a very hot question on Zhihu:" Is it possible to pull 1.4 billion Chinese people into a WeChat group technically? "
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, as of the end of 2017, the total population of mainland China was 1,390.8 million (including 31 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and Chinese military servicemen, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese Number), already more than 1.3 billion.    
      </p>
      <p>
       At present, the maximum number of WeChat group members is 500, pulling nearly 1.4 billion Chinese into a WeChat group. Is the reality considered from a technical perspective? How many servers are needed?

       And in a group of 1.4 billion people, how to grab red envelopes? Will the phone explode?
      </p>
      <p>
       This question blew up Tencent's official answer:
       Let me talk about the conclusion first: maybe it can be achieved, but you will see nothing. 
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the public data of the "WeChat Data Report" in 2017 [Reference 1]: In September 2017, WeChat logged an average of 902 million people a day and sent messages 38 billion times a day.   
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that on average, each person sends 42 messages per day. If the people of the country (yes, the population of the country is now close to 1.4 billion) speak in the same group, the number of messages that appear in this group every day is as high as:
      </p>
      <p>
       If so much information is only sent at a constant rate, considering everyone's sleep, 8 hours of sleep is not counted, then the information to be received per second in the mobile phone is:
       Wow, more than 1 million items per second! At present, one of the highest frequency mobile phone CPUs, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 has a processing capacity of 2.8GHz [Reference 2], which is a total of 8 cores.
      </p>
      <p>
       If CPU operations such as Android system, display refresh, and network IO are not calculated, the computing power to which each piece of information can be allocated is:
       What is this concept? The world's first microprocessor is the Intel 4004 [Reference 3] introduced by Intel in 1971, and the frequency of this old antique is also 108KHz. So 21.9KHz can't do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, there is Moore's Law in the IT world: CPU performance can be doubled (or half the price) every 18 months. Although the existing technology is difficult to increase the main frequency (a toothpaste factory desperately squeezed only 5 Ghz).
      </p>
      <p>
       But suppose we use black technology to increase the main frequency. When 2025 Moore's Law fails [reference 4], our mobile phone CPU frequency should reach:

       It looks good, but the computing power available for each message will reach:
       This is almost the distance of the airplane route from China to the United States, and it is enough to build railways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, with so many equipment blessings, you can finally enter the group happily.

       But you are surprised to find that there is nothing but white on the screen-this is because your eyes cannot receive such fast data!

       The visual retention time of the human eye is 100-400 milliseconds [reference 9], and our group displays 1.02 million messages per second, and each message stays for only about 0.001 milliseconds. In contrast, movies and TV have 41 milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you haven't had time to read the news, it has disappeared, and finally only a white color patch is left in the center of the screen.
      </p>
